# Javascript Review Exercise

In this exercise, you'll build a simple 2D game. 

## Exercise instructions

To get started, review the following files:
`/game.html`

`/game.css`

`/game.js`

Right click on the `/game.html` file and open with Live Server. Use your arrow keys to move the spaceship around the screen.  Notice if you travel to Planet 1 that your planet count increments in the top right corner, and a message is displayed that you are entering Planet 1. The message will change to indicate when you leave.

Complete the game by capturing when the spaceship visits Planet 2 and Planet 3, and alerting the user that they have won by visiting all planets. 

However, if you have other ideas for what you want this game to do - go for it. Feel free to swap out the images and modify / add functionality.
